      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Just had to post this wonderful recipe. My brother always told me his wife couldn't boil water if her life depended on it. We came from a family where every female loved to cook. My poor baby brother married someone who had never cooked. Boy did he enjoy family dinners, lol...... Anyways, I wrote this recipe on a piece of paper for my SIL as a joke and recently her and my dearly departed brother's daughter, my niece, gave me the little piece of paper I wrote it on. In memory of my baby brother, here is my recipe for boiled water :)</p>
