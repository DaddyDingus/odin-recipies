        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>As a child, I spent countless hours in the kitchen with my grandmother, who was a master at making lasagne. Her recipe was a closely guarded family secret, and I eagerly watched and learned every step of the process.</p>
        <p>Today, my lasagne recipe is a reflection of the love and care that went into every meal shared with my family. It's a tribute to the past and a celebration of the present, and a promise to carry on the cilinary legacy that began in my grandmother's kitchen so many years ago.</p>

         </ul>
        <h4>CHEESE SAUCE (BESCIAMELLA):</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>60g butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
            <li>4 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 cups gruyere or Colby cheese</li>
            <li>Pinch of freshly ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>LASAGNE</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>350g fresh lasagne sheets</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Finely chopped basil or parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>RAGU:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet – they should not brown (if they do, turn heat down).</li>
            <li>Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go.</li>
            <li>Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.</li>
            <li>Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 - 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich - Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if required</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>CHEESE SAUCE</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm milk up in a saucepan (optional – just makes sauce thicken faster).</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium low heat. Add flour and mix constantly for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Pour about 1 cup of the milk in, mixing as you go to incorporate into the flour mixture. Once mostly lump free, add remaining milk. Use a whisk if needed to make it lump free.</li>
            <li>Turn heat up to medium high. Stir occasionally at first then regularly after a few minutes until sauce thickens – about 5 – 8 minutes. It should coat the back of the wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, add cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mix until the cheese is melted. The Sauce should be thick but still easily pourable – the consistency of heavy cream (you need to be able to drizzle it over the Ragu when layering – see video). If it’s too thick, add a splash of water or milk.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>ASSEMBLE</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180°C</li>
            <li>Use a 33 x 22 x 7 cm / 13 x 9 x 2.5″ baking dish.</li>
            <li>Smear a bit of Ragu on the base, then cover with lasagna sheets. Tear sheets to fit.</li>
            <li>Top with lasagna sheets3. Spread with another 2 1/2 cups of Ragu, then 1 cup of Cheese Sauce. Top with lasagna sheets then repeat 1 more time.</li>
            <li>Top with a 4th layer of lasagna sheets, then pour over the remaining Cheese Sauce.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with Mozzarella, then bake for 25 minutes or until golden and bubbling.</li>
            <li>Stand for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving, garnished with basil or parsley if desired.</li>
        </ol>
