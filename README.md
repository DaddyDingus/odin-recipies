Current project is creating this repo and setting up this README.md file. The skills I have demonstrated thus far include using CLI to navigate and create files/directories, push git commands, and basic use of VSCode. I have began learning the fundamentals of HTML, including elements, tags, and attributes. I now know how to acher a link, open said link in a new window while taking security measures into consideration, insert images and create lists.
